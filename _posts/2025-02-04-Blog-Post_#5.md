# Inspir Altair ..

# Map Chart - Success

I was scrolling through the r/dataisbeautiful subreddit and I found this interesting graph showing the presence of farmland in the United States. I would put a picture of it here, but unfortunately it has since been deleted by the person who made it. But basically, it showed points on the graph where there was a large share of farmland. It used color and position to show, where and to what degree abundances of farmland were present. I chose to try and recreate it because out of all the graphs it was the one that caught my attention. Unfortunately, there weren't any Vega Datasets that show latitude and longitude data, outside of the Airports dataset, and I decided not to use that, because I used it as a source to learn about map visualization.

## The Dataset

For this project, I created a custom dataset with the names, latitudes, and longitudes of 15 major US cities. Here’s what the dataset looks like:

```
import pandas as pd

custom_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': [
        'New York', 'Los Angeles', 'Chicago', 'Houston', 'Phoenix',
        'San Francisco', 'Seattle', 'Boston', 'Dallas', 'Miami',
        'Denver', 'Atlanta', 'Philadelphia', 'Washington, D.C.', 'Austin'
    ],
    'latitude': [
        40.7128, 34.0522, 41.8781, 29.7604, 33.4484,
        37.7749, 47.6062, 42.3601, 32.7767, 25.7617,
        39.7392, 33.7490, 39.9526, 38.9072, 30.2672
    ],
    'longitude': [
        -74.0060, -118.2437, -87.6298, -95.3698, -112.0740,
        -122.4194, -122.3321, -71.0589, -96.7970, -80.1918,
        -104.9903, -84.3880, -75.1652, -77.0369, -97.7431
    ]
})
```

This dataset includes cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, and more. Each city has a name, latitude, and longitude.

## Building the Map

To create the map, I used Altair’s geographic capabilities. Here’s the step-by-step process:

### Step 1: Load the US States Map

First, I loaded the US states dataset from Vega’s us_10m collection. This dataset provides the geographic boundaries for all 50 states.

```
import altair as alt
from vega_datasets import data

us_states = alt.topo_feature(data.us_10m.url, 'states')
```

### Step 2: Create the Base Map

Next, I created the base map using mark_geoshape(). This function draws the outlines of the US states and fills them with a light gray color.

```
# Create the base map
base = alt.Chart(us_states).mark_geoshape(
    fill="lightgray",
    stroke="white"
).project(
    "albersUsa"
).properties(
    width=800,
    height=500
)
```

### Step 3: Add the Custom Data Points

With the base map ready, I added the custom data points using mark_circle(). Each point represents a city, and I encoded the latitude and longitude to position them correctly on the map.

```
# Create the points layer
points = alt.Chart(custom_data).mark_circle(
    color='red', 
    size=100   
).encode(
    longitude='longitude:Q', 
    latitude='latitude:Q',  
    tooltip='name:N'   
).project(
    "albersUsa" 
).properties(
    width=800,
    height=500
)
```

### Step 4: Combine the Base Map and Points

Finally, I combined the base map and the points layer using the + operator. This overlays the points on top of the map.

```
# Combine the base map and points
base + points
```


## Here’s what the final map looks like:

# Simulating Planetary Orbits with Altair - Maybe Success?

I was inspired by an article from the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/01/30/science/mars-landing-trump.html). I've always had an interest in astronomy and space exploration. I found this chart very interesting because it very clearly showed the time windows necessary for space travel. It uses points as marks, and color, position, and labels as channels.

## The Dataset

For this project, I generated synthetic data representing planetary positions over time. The dataset includes Earth and Mars, along with a calculated position for Mars offset by seven months, and where a spacecraft would arrive in 7 months if launched from earth. Here’s how I structured the data:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

planets = {
    "Earth": {"radius": 1.00, "period": 365},
    "Mars": {"radius": 1.52, "period": 687},
    "Mars in 7 months": {"radius": 1.52, "period": 687},
    "Arrival in 7 months": {"radius": 1.52, "period": 365},
}

time = np.arange(0, 366, 1)

# Simulate planet positions over time
data = []
for planet, info in planets.items():
    radius = info["radius"]
    period = info["period"]
    
    # Apply a phase shift ONLY for "Mars in 7 months"
    phase_shift = 210 if planet == "Mars in 7 months" else 0
    
    # Compute X, Y positions with optional phase shift
    x = radius * np.cos(2 * np.pi * (time + phase_shift) / period)
    y = radius * np.sin(2 * np.pi * (time + phase_shift) / period)
    
    # Store data
    for t, xi, yi in zip(time, x, y):
        data.append({"Planet": planet, "Time": t, "X": xi, "Y": yi})

# Convert to DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
```

This dataset simulates circular orbits based on each planet’s radius and orbital period. The key feature is the phase shift applied to "Mars in 7 months," which allows us to see where Mars would be if we fast-forwarded time by seven months.

## Creating the Visualization

To visualize this data, I used Altair, a powerful declarative visualization library for Python.

### Step 1: Adding an Interactive Time Slider

First, I created a slider to control the time variable interactively.

```python
import altair as alt

time_slider = alt.binding_range(min=0, max=365, step=1, name='Time: ')
slider_selection = alt.selection_point(name="Time", fields=["Time"], bind=time_slider, value=0)
```

This slider allows users to adjust the visualization to see the planetary positions at different points in time.

### Step 2: Building the Orbital Chart

Next, I created a scatter plot to represent the planets' positions in their orbits.

```python
chart = alt.Chart(df).mark_point(filled=True, size=100).encode(
    x=alt.X("X:Q", axis=None, scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-2, 2])), 
    y=alt.Y("Y:Q", axis=None, scale=alt.Scale(domain=[-2, 2])), 
    color=alt.Color("Planet:N", legend=None),
    tooltip=["Planet:N", "Time:Q"]
).properties(
    width=500,
    height=500,
    title="Earth and Mars Orbits (Zoomed In)"
).configure_view(
    strokeWidth=0 
).add_params(
    slider_selection
).transform_filter(
    slider_selection 
)
```

### Step 3: Displaying the Interactive Visualization

Finally, I combined everything into an interactive visualization where users can explore planetary positions over time.

## Conclusion

I really enjoyed creating this chart, but I feel like there is a lot of stuff I would like to go back and work on, including adding the dotted circles, and a more accurate representation of the flight from earth to mars.
