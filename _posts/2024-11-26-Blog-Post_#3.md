# Lab #2: World Bank API

## Choosing Indicators

I am doing a unit in history on the environmentalist and climate movements and I thought it might be interesting to try and get data to determine what some of the cause of CO2 emissions might be. I choose Electricity Production from Coal Sources and Literacy Rate in addition to the three that were included in the start. The former is pretty self explanatory, but I choose the latter, Literacy Rate, because I thought it would be very interesting to see if there is some correlation due educated people generally being more aware of climate change.

However, I didn't realize that there was not sufficient data for CO2 Emissions, Literacy Rate, and Electricity from Coal Sources for most countries I picked. This highlights a shortcoming of the API.

I chose to look at only recent years, 2023-2015, because the climate movement has become more popular in those years and I chose countries from around the world: Western Europe, West Africa, East Asia, North America, and the Middle East to try to get a diverse look.

## Bug fixing

I received quite a lot of null data that was messing with my code. I was able to fix this using code such as:

'''
if entry["value"] is not None:
'''
When writing into the csv, the code writes "None" attributes as blank.


## Observations

Because of the lack of data I was able to retrieve from the API I was unable to see many correlations. However, there did seem to be a positive correlation between Literacy Rate, GDP per capita, and Life Expectancy

## Next Steps

- Task 4 coming soon

- I think due to a lack of data, when I attempt Task #4 I will have to try different indicators.
