# Trustworthiness Report on "Farmers Preferences for Incentives on Solar Pumps: Evidence from a Choice Experiment in Punjab"

**Authors:** Sukhgeet Kaur and Michael G. Pollitt 
**Institution:** Energy Policy Research Group, University of Cambridge 
**Stable URL:** <https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep60754> 
**Accessed on:** October 25, 2024

1. Introduction

This research paper, carried out by academics from Cambridge University and published through the Energy Policy Research Group, looks into the farmers' preference for financial incentives on solar pumps in Punjab. I would like to check the reliability of this paper, founded on criteria that include credentials of the authors, institutional affiliation, transparency in the presentation of data, rigor in the methods adopted, and reliability of the platform on which the source is situated. Well, I didn't choose this paper; it chose me. I was browsing for space research papers, but nothing was really there that I would want to write about; then, I came across this paper and found it pretty interesting.

## 2. Authorship and Institutional Affiliation

Authors: Sukhgeet Kaur and Michael G. Pollitt at the University of Cambridge are experienced researchers. Pollitt is Professor of Business Economics at Cambridge Judge Business School and brings a great deal of credibility with his extensive background in energy economics.
- **Institution**: The Cambridge Energy Policy Research Group is considered a very reputable institution as it works and undertakes research on drawing policy implications with regard to energy and climate change, so that adds on the reliability of the research.

## 3. Source Platform: JSTOR

The source was found on JSTOR, a reliable source in finding research articles.

## 4. Research Methodology

The paper tests the farmers' acceptance of the solar pump with various incentive schemes. The researches developed the following hypotheses:

Null Hypothesis: There is no significant difference in farmers' preference for solar pumps by the magnitude of subsidies and buyback rates.
H1: Higher subsidies and good buyback rates increase the possibility of farmers' choosing solar pumps over conventional diesel or electric pumps by many folds.

The present study investigates the choice situations made by farmers to ascertain if the results follow a strong pattern where the main hypothesis, the null hypothesis, can be rejected in support of a new hypothesis, the alternative hypothesis. By analyzing the farmers' response to the different levels of subsidy and buyback rate, the study tested whether financial incentives really motivated the farmers to adopt solar pumps. Results are more reliable with a large sample size and with specialized methods-mixed logit and conditional logit models-employed in the analysis, which further reinforces confidence in this method of testing.

## 5. Data Reliability and Bias Considerations

The data are collected through personal interviews; I would say this improves the prospects for getting accurate and context-specific responses. However, the authors do note some weaknesses, such as hypothetical bias in stated preference methods which might affect external validity. They recommend further research to reduce this bias.

## 6. Key Findings and Implications

The results indicate that:

Financial incentives, particularly in the form of high capital subsidies and good buyback rates, are an important driver for the adoption of solar pumps.
Regional preferences indicate that region-specific policies are needed.

These recommendations logically follow from a huge set of data analysis and therefore carry a lot of weight in giving validity to the research.

## 7. Conclusion

The position of this research as a source of information about farmers' response to renewable energy incentives is: because of
1. Credibility of the author and the affiliation.
2. Transparency in methodology and data analysis.
3. The academic publishing standard on JSTOR being quite rigorous.

This could be further improved by making their data open, so that independent analyses of the study can be done by anyone.
