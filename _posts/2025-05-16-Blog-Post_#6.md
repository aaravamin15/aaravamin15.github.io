This is a blog post for my First Draft of Microplastics

# MICROPLASTICS (Draft)

## Introduction

Back in 10th Grade for a semester project in Chemistry, I examined the effect of Microplastics on Marine life. Even earlier in middle school I learned about the dangers of Microplastics to marine ecosystems. Microplastics are something that have been an issue for years, decades even. And yet, nothing real has been done to combat the pollution of our oceans. Even more than that, microplastics continue to be a health risk to humans. Microplastic consumption has been linked to neurotoxicity, DNA Damage, metabolic disorder, and even heart attacks and stroke.

## Data

I am using two main datasets for my study, one on the prevalence of microplastics in our marine ecosystems and another on the pollution of our drinking water. The first dataset comes from the [National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/microplastics). It is a dataset that details oceanic areas in which there are high concentrations of Microplastics. The second dataset comes from the [State Of California's Water Resources Control Board](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/microplastics-in-drinking-water). This dataset provides data about the pollutions levels of different countries drinking water.
