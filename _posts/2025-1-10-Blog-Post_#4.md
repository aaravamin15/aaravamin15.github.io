This is a blog post to show my thoughts behind Lab #3

# Lab #3

In the wake of my favorite baseball team, the New York Yankees, losing Juan Soto to our crosstown rival Mets for the largest contract in sports history, I decided to look at how salary drives performance. Obviously people with larger salaries are often better, but by how much? Are they usually worth it? I also wanted to see what metrics make players the most money.

While scrolling on Kaggle, I came across a baseball database that tracked every important offensive stat from the 1986-1987 MLB season, and those player's career numbers. By looking at this data, I hoped to get insights that would help me answer my questions.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset required some preprocessing to prepare it for analysis. Key steps included:

**Handling Missing Data**: Missing values in the 'Salary' column were deleted to avoid contaminating the data.

**Categorical Data Conversion**: I changed the columns 'League,' 'Division,' and 'NewLeague' to categorical types for efficient processing.

## Distribution of Salary

**Note: Salary in this data set is represented in thousands**

I visualized the distribution of player salaries using a histogram. The results showed a right-skewed distribution, with a small number of players earning significantly higher salaries compared to the majority.

## Relationships

Then, I decided to use scatterplots to visualize the differences between salary and the baseball metrics. Here are a couple:

As you can see, players with highers salary get more hits and hit more home runs than players with less salary. This was the same for the other metrics: Walks, Runs, and RBIs. Which makes sense. But, I discovered a possible reason for this when looking at the graph of salary vs AtBats:

![graph](https://aaravamin15.github.io/assets/img/Salaryvsatbat.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

Clearly players with more salary get significantly more chances to get hits, walks, etc. So, to fix this, I divided each metic by the number of at bats that player had. And while I got the same general correlations, it was a lot less profound than before.

Here is my graph of Salary vs Average (hits per at bat):

And here is my graph of Salary vs Home runs per at bat:

![graph](https://aaravamin15.github.io/assets/img/SalaryvsHr/Atb.png){: .mx-auto.d-block :}

As you can see, while there still is a positive correlation, there is much less of one than before.

## Conclusions

Obviously, since this dataset contains data taken almost 40 years ago, it won't track with 100% certainty onto modern day baseball.

As for my questions here are my conclusions

 **Obviously people with larger salaries are often better, but by how much?** 
    Its hard to quantify. The players with the best batting averages were all amongst the highest paid, but there were plenty of "value" players that had similar performance and cost much less. Except for one outlier, if you paid a player a lot of money, you knew you were getting solid performance out of them, which is not the case for player who were payed less.
 
**What metrics make players the most money?**
    Batting average. Its pretty clear based on my graphs that player with high batting averages get paid more, and the players with the highest batting average get paid the most. For other metrics, yes there are positive relationships, but the ones with the most of the metric don't get paid the most.
 
 **Are they usually worth it?**
    Another really hard question. The highest paid player in that season hit 0.305, while the median player hit 0.262. That player made $2,460,000 while the median player made $425,000. That's 4 extra hits per 100 at bats. Those 4 hits could be the difference between winning or losing 4 games. I think that is significant enough to be worth it.
