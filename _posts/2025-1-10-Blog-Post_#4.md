This is a blog post to show my thoughts behind Lab #3

# Lab #3

In the wake of my favorite baseball team, the New York Yankees, losing Juan Soto to our crosstown rival Mets for the largest contract in sports history, I decided to look at how salary drives performance. Obviously people with larger salaries are often better, but by how much? Are they usually worth it? I also wanted to see what metrics make players the most money.

While scrolling on Kaggle, I came across a baseball database that tracked every important offensive stat from the 1986-1987 MLB season, and those player's career numbers. By looking at this data, I hoped to get insights that would help me answer my questions.

## Data Cleaning

The dataset required some preprocessing to prepare it for analysis. Key steps included:

**Handling Missing Data**: Missing values in the 'Salary' column were deleted to avoid contaminating the data.

**Categorical Data Conversion**: I changed the columns 'League,' 'Division,' and 'NewLeague' to categorical types for efficient processing.

## Distribution of Salary

I visualized the distribution of player salaries using a histogram. The results showed a right-skewed distribution, with a small number of players earning significantly higher salaries compared to the majority.

## Relationships

Then, I decided to use scatterplots to visualize the differences between salary and the baseball metrics. Here are a couple:

As you can see, players with highers salary get more hits and hit more home runs than players with less salary. This was the same for the other metrics: Walks, Runs, and RBIs. Which makes sense. But, I discovered a possible reason for this when looking at the graph of salary vs AtBats:

Clearly players with more salary get significantly more chances to get hits, walks, etc. So, to fix this, I divided each metic by the number of at bats that player had. And while I got the same general correlations, it was a lot less profound than before.

Here is my graph of Salary vs Average(hits per at bat):
